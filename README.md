# Style transfer with preservation of the central objects of the scene.
Add styles from famous paintings to any photo with preservation of the central objects of the scene.

<p align = 'center'>
<img src = 'Images/githubpic.jpg' height = '700px'>
</p>

## Documentation

### Stylizing photo
Use `style.py` to transfer style into a photo (don't forget to dowload pretrained models). Run `python style.py -h` to view all the possible parameters or you can see them below
- `img_path` : Path to content image.
- `style_img_path` : Path to style image.
- `directory` : Directory where result image would be saved.
- `name` : Name of result image.
- `weight_function` : Type of function, that would be used for finding weight matrix.
           Possible values: _patch_ &mdash; simple patch method;
            _moving_patch_ &mdash; moving patch method;
            _superpixel_ &mdash; superpixel method;
            _segmentation_ &mdash; segmentation method;
            _gatys_ &mdash; standard Gatys algorithm.

-  `contrast` : Contrast coefficient, optional parameter. Default value equal to one.
      Bigger value means, that front object will have bigger values in weight matrix.
-  `img_size` : Minimal size side of resulting picture, optional parameter.
-  `grid_size` : Size of grid grid_size x grid_size, optional parameter.

Example usage:

    python style.py .\Images\content.jpg .\Images\style.jpg .\report\ Stylization segmentation

    
    





### Requirements
You will need the following to run the above:
 - Dowload pretrained [segmentation model](https://yadi.sk/d/hcNhRltixuxIVw) and [vgg19 model](https://yadi.sk/d/yxJrNraRcujGCA) and put them to models directory.
 - [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
 - [segmentation_models_pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch)
 - [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py)
 - [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations)
 - [catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst)
 - Nvidia GPU. All results were produced on the video card NVIDIA RTX 2080 super with 8GB memory.
 
## Examples
Need to add different exmples of algorithm work. Were people could see difference on different pictures.
